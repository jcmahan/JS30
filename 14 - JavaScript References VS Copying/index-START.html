    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['James', 'Mike', 'Jon', 'Zo'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; 
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Tara';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();
team2[3] = 'Tara';
    // one way


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players]
team4[3] = 'Slocum'

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5.splice(1,0,'Tara');
    team5.splice(1,0,'Andrew');

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; 
    // captain.number = 99; 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
  const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'James Mahan', number: 99, age: 12} );
  console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
